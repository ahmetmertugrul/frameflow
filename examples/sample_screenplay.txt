==========================================================


1. INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office is cluttered with case files and cold coffee cups. Rain
streams down the windows. DETECTIVE ALEX REEVES sits at his desk,
staring at crime scene photos spread across the surface.

                    ALEX
              (to himself)
          Three victims. Three different
          cities. Same signature.

DR. SARAH CHEN enters, carrying two fresh coffees.

                    SARAH
          You're seeing a pattern the
          others missed.

                    ALEX
          Or I'm seeing things that aren't
          there. Wouldn't be the first time.

Sarah sets a coffee on his desk and studies the photos.

                    SARAH
          The placement of the evidence...
          it's deliberate. Like someone
          wants you to find it.

                    ALEX
          A message?

                    SARAH
          Or a warning.


2. EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAWN

Yellow police tape flutters in the morning breeze. Alex and Sarah
approach the abandoned warehouse. Forensic teams work methodically.

Alex stops suddenly, his hand instinctively moving to his weapon.

                    ALEX
          Something's wrong.

                    SARAH
          What is it?

                    ALEX
          I've been here before.
              (beat)
          In a dream.


3. INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

They enter the dark space. Shafts of light cut through broken windows.
Alex's flashlight beam catches something on the wall - a symbol drawn
in what appears to be ash.

                    ALEX
          That symbol...

Sarah photographs it with her phone.

                    SARAH
          It's not in any database I know.
          But look at the precision. This
          wasn't done hastily.

Alex moves deeper into the warehouse. His footsteps echo.

Suddenly, a FIGURE darts across his beam of light.

                    ALEX
          Police! Stop!

He gives chase, Sarah following close behind.


4. EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Alex bursts through a side door into a narrow alley. The figure is
gone. But there, on the ground, is a photograph.

Alex picks it up, his hands trembling. It's a photo of him, taken
yesterday, that he's certain no one else knew existed.

                    ALEX
              (whispered)
          How...?

Sarah catches up, out of breath.

                    SARAH
          Did you lose them?

Alex shows her the photo. Her expression darkens.

                    SARAH
          Alex, whoever this is... they've
          been watching you. This is personal.


5. INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alex sits in the dark, the case files spread around him. The symbol
from the warehouse is sketched on a notepad.

His phone buzzes. Unknown number. He answers.

                    VOICE (V.O.)
              (distorted)
          You're getting close, Detective.
          But are you ready for the truth?

                    ALEX
          Who is this?

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          You already know. You've always
          known. Check your mirror.

The line goes dead. Alex slowly stands and walks to the mirror on
the wall.

In the reflection, standing behind him, is THE SHADOW.

Alex spins around. Nobody there.

He looks back at the mirror. The Shadow is still there, in the
reflection, but not in the room.

The Shadow raises a hand... and Alex sees his own hand, with the
same scar, the same watch... but older. Worn.

                    ALEX
              (horrified realization)
          No... it can't be...

FADE TO BLACK.
